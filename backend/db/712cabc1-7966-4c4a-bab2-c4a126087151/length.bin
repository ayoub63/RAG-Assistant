Observation: With RandomForestRegressor, RFE and Forward Selection achieved 
slightly higher RÂ² scores (~0.007 above other FSMs), though still below the baseline 
(0.484).
H4 : Wrapper-based FSMs may preserve feature combinations better suited to Random 
Forest, resulting in slightly improved perf
